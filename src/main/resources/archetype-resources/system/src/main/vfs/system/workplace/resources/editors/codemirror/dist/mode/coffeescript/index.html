${symbol_pound} Baseline setup
${symbol_pound} --------------

${symbol_pound} Establish the root object, `window` in the browser, or `global` on the server.
root = this


${symbol_pound} Save the previous value of the `_` variable.
previousUnderscore = root._

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Multiline
    comment
${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}

${symbol_pound} Establish the object that gets thrown to break out of a loop iteration.
${symbol_pound} `StopIteration` is SOP on Mozilla.
breaker = if typeof(StopIteration) is 'undefined' then '__break__' else StopIteration


${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Docco style single line comment (title)


${symbol_pound} Helper function to escape **RegExp** contents, because JS doesn't have one.
escapeRegExp = (string) -> string.replace(/([.*+?^${symbol_dollar}{}()|[${symbol_escape}]${symbol_escape}/${symbol_escape}${symbol_escape}])/g, '${symbol_escape}${symbol_escape}${symbol_dollar}1')


${symbol_pound} Save bytes in the minified (but not gzipped) version:
ArrayProto = Array.prototype
ObjProto = Object.prototype


${symbol_pound} Create quick reference variables for speed access to core prototypes.
slice = ArrayProto.slice
unshift = ArrayProto.unshift
toString = ObjProto.toString
hasOwnProperty = ObjProto.hasOwnProperty
propertyIsEnumerable = ObjProto.propertyIsEnumerable


${symbol_pound} All **ECMA5** native implementations we hope to use are declared here.
nativeForEach = ArrayProto.forEach
nativeMap = ArrayProto.map
nativeReduce = ArrayProto.reduce
nativeReduceRight = ArrayProto.reduceRight
nativeFilter = ArrayProto.filter
nativeEvery = ArrayProto.every
nativeSome = ArrayProto.some
nativeIndexOf = ArrayProto.indexOf
nativeLastIndexOf = ArrayProto.lastIndexOf
nativeIsArray = Array.isArray
nativeKeys = Object.keys


${symbol_pound} Create a safe reference to the Underscore object for use below.
_ = (obj) -> new wrapper(obj)


${symbol_pound} Export the Underscore object for **CommonJS**.
if typeof(exports) != 'undefined' then exports._ = _


${symbol_pound} Export Underscore to global scope.
root._ = _


${symbol_pound} Current version.
_.VERSION = '1.1.0'


${symbol_pound} Collection Functions
${symbol_pound} --------------------

${symbol_pound} The cornerstone, an **each** implementation.
${symbol_pound} Handles objects implementing **forEach**, arrays, and raw objects.
_.each = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  try
    if nativeForEach and obj.forEach is nativeForEach
      obj.forEach iterator, context
    else if _.isNumber obj.length
      iterator.call context, obj[i], i, obj for i in [0...obj.length]
    else
      iterator.call context, val, key, obj for own key, val of obj
  catch e
    throw e if e isnt breaker
  obj


${symbol_pound} Return the results of applying the iterator to each element. Use JavaScript
${symbol_pound} 1.6's version of **map**, if possible.
_.map = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  return obj.map(iterator, context) if nativeMap and obj.map is nativeMap
  results = []
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    results.push iterator.call context, value, index, list
  results


${symbol_pound} **Reduce** builds up a single result from a list of values. Also known as
${symbol_pound} **inject**, or **foldl**. Uses JavaScript 1.8's version of **reduce**, if possible.
_.reduce = (obj, iterator, memo, context) ->
  if nativeReduce and obj.reduce is nativeReduce
    iterator = _.bind iterator, context if context
    return obj.reduce iterator, memo
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    memo = iterator.call context, memo, value, index, list
  memo


${symbol_pound} The right-associative version of **reduce**, also known as **foldr**. Uses
${symbol_pound} JavaScript 1.8's version of **reduceRight**, if available.
_.reduceRight = (obj, iterator, memo, context) ->
  if nativeReduceRight and obj.reduceRight is nativeReduceRight
    iterator = _.bind iterator, context if context
    return obj.reduceRight iterator, memo
  reversed = _.clone(_.toArray(obj)).reverse()
  _.reduce reversed, iterator, memo, context


${symbol_pound} Return the first value which passes a truth test.
_.detect = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  result = null
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    if iterator.call context, value, index, list
      result = value
      _.breakLoop()
  result


${symbol_pound} Return all the elements that pass a truth test. Use JavaScript 1.6's
${symbol_pound} **filter**, if it exists.
_.filter = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  return obj.filter iterator, context if nativeFilter and obj.filter is nativeFilter
  results = []
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    results.push value if iterator.call context, value, index, list
  results


${symbol_pound} Return all the elements for which a truth test fails.
_.reject = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  results = []
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    results.push value if not iterator.call context, value, index, list
  results


${symbol_pound} Determine whether all of the elements match a truth test. Delegate to
${symbol_pound} JavaScript 1.6's **every**, if it is present.
_.every = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  iterator ||= _.identity
  return obj.every iterator, context if nativeEvery and obj.every is nativeEvery
  result = true
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    _.breakLoop() unless (result = result and iterator.call(context, value, index, list))
  result


${symbol_pound} Determine if at least one element in the object matches a truth test. Use
${symbol_pound} JavaScript 1.6's **some**, if it exists.
_.some = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  iterator ||= _.identity
  return obj.some iterator, context if nativeSome and obj.some is nativeSome
  result = false
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    _.breakLoop() if (result = iterator.call(context, value, index, list))
  result


${symbol_pound} Determine if a given value is included in the array or object,
${symbol_pound} based on `===`.
_.include = (obj, target) ->
  return _.indexOf(obj, target) isnt -1 if nativeIndexOf and obj.indexOf is nativeIndexOf
  return true for own key, val of obj when val is target
  false


${symbol_pound} Invoke a method with arguments on every item in a collection.
_.invoke = (obj, method) ->
  args = _.rest arguments, 2
  (if method then val[method] else val).apply(val, args) for val in obj


${symbol_pound} Convenience version of a common use case of **map**: fetching a property.
_.pluck = (obj, key) ->
  _.map(obj, (val) -> val[key])


${symbol_pound} Return the maximum item or (item-based computation).
_.max = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  return Math.max.apply(Math, obj) if not iterator and _.isArray(obj)
  result = computed: -Infinity
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    computed = if iterator then iterator.call(context, value, index, list) else value
    computed >= result.computed and (result = {value: value, computed: computed})
  result.value


${symbol_pound} Return the minimum element (or element-based computation).
_.min = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  return Math.min.apply(Math, obj) if not iterator and _.isArray(obj)
  result = computed: Infinity
  _.each obj, (value, index, list) ->
    computed = if iterator then iterator.call(context, value, index, list) else value
    computed < result.computed and (result = {value: value, computed: computed})
  result.value


${symbol_pound} Sort the object's values by a criterion produced by an iterator.
_.sortBy = (obj, iterator, context) ->
  _.pluck(((_.map obj, (value, index, list) ->
    {value: value, criteria: iterator.call(context, value, index, list)}
  ).sort((left, right) ->
    a = left.criteria; b = right.criteria
    if a < b then -1 else if a > b then 1 else 0
  )), 'value')


${symbol_pound} Use a comparator function to figure out at what index an object should
${symbol_pound} be inserted so as to maintain order. Uses binary search.
_.sortedIndex = (array, obj, iterator) ->
  iterator ||= _.identity
  low = 0
  high = array.length
  while low < high
    mid = (low + high) >> 1
    if iterator(array[mid]) < iterator(obj) then low = mid + 1 else high = mid
  low


${symbol_pound} Convert anything iterable into a real, live array.
_.toArray = (iterable) ->
  return [] if (!iterable)
  return iterable.toArray() if (iterable.toArray)
  return iterable if (_.isArray(iterable))
  return slice.call(iterable) if (_.isArguments(iterable))
  _.values(iterable)


${symbol_pound} Return the number of elements in an object.
_.size = (obj) -> _.toArray(obj).length


${symbol_pound} Array Functions
${symbol_pound} ---------------

${symbol_pound} Get the first element of an array. Passing `n` will return the first N
${symbol_pound} values in the array. Aliased as **head**. The `guard` check allows it to work
${symbol_pound} with **map**.
_.first = (array, n, guard) ->
  if n and not guard then slice.call(array, 0, n) else array[0]


${symbol_pound} Returns everything but the first entry of the array. Aliased as **tail**.
${symbol_pound} Especially useful on the arguments object. Passing an `index` will return
${symbol_pound} the rest of the values in the array from that index onward. The `guard`
${symbol_pound} check allows it to work with **map**.
_.rest = (array, index, guard) ->
  slice.call(array, if _.isUndefined(index) or guard then 1 else index)


${symbol_pound} Get the last element of an array.
_.last = (array) -> array[array.length - 1]


${symbol_pound} Trim out all falsy values from an array.
_.compact = (array) -> item for item in array when item


${symbol_pound} Return a completely flattened version of an array.
_.flatten = (array) ->
  _.reduce array, (memo, value) ->
    return memo.concat(_.flatten(value)) if _.isArray value
    memo.push value
    memo
  , []


${symbol_pound} Return a version of the array that does not contain the specified value(s).
_.without = (array) ->
  values = _.rest arguments
  val for val in _.toArray(array) when not _.include values, val


${symbol_pound} Produce a duplicate-free version of the array. If the array has already
${symbol_pound} been sorted, you have the option of using a faster algorithm.
_.uniq = (array, isSorted) ->
  memo = []
  for el, i in _.toArray array
    memo.push el if i is 0 || (if isSorted is true then _.last(memo) isnt el else not _.include(memo, el))
  memo


${symbol_pound} Produce an array that contains every item shared between all the
${symbol_pound} passed-in arrays.
_.intersect = (array) ->
  rest = _.rest arguments
  _.select _.uniq(array), (item) ->
    _.all rest, (other) ->
      _.indexOf(other, item) >= 0


${symbol_pound} Zip together multiple lists into a single array -- elements that share
${symbol_pound} an index go together.
_.zip = ->
  length = _.max _.pluck arguments, 'length'
  results = new Array length
  for i in [0...length]
    results[i] = _.pluck arguments, String i
  results


${symbol_pound} If the browser doesn't supply us with **indexOf** (I'm looking at you, MSIE),
${symbol_pound} we need this function. Return the position of the first occurrence of an
${symbol_pound} item in an array, or -1 if the item is not included in the array.
_.indexOf = (array, item) ->
  return array.indexOf item if nativeIndexOf and array.indexOf is nativeIndexOf
  i = 0; l = array.length
  while l - i
    if array[i] is item then return i else i++
  -1


${symbol_pound} Provide JavaScript 1.6's **lastIndexOf**, delegating to the native function,
${symbol_pound} if possible.
_.lastIndexOf = (array, item) ->
  return array.lastIndexOf(item) if nativeLastIndexOf and array.lastIndexOf is nativeLastIndexOf
  i = array.length
  while i
    if array[i] is item then return i else i--
  -1


${symbol_pound} Generate an integer Array containing an arithmetic progression. A port of
${symbol_pound} [the native Python **range** function](http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html${symbol_pound}range).
_.range = (start, stop, step) ->
  a = arguments
  solo = a.length <= 1
  i = start = if solo then 0 else a[0]
  stop = if solo then a[0] else a[1]
  step = a[2] or 1
  len = Math.ceil((stop - start) / step)
  return [] if len <= 0
  range = new Array len
  idx = 0
  loop
    return range if (if step > 0 then i - stop else stop - i) >= 0
    range[idx] = i
    idx++
    i+= step


${symbol_pound} Function Functions
${symbol_pound} ------------------

${symbol_pound} Create a function bound to a given object (assigning `this`, and arguments,
${symbol_pound} optionally). Binding with arguments is also known as **curry**.
_.bind = (func, obj) ->
  args = _.rest arguments, 2
  -> func.apply obj or root, args.concat arguments


${symbol_pound} Bind all of an object's methods to that object. Useful for ensuring that
${symbol_pound} all callbacks defined on an object belong to it.

  _.each funcs, (f) -> obj[f] = _.bind obj[f], obj
  obj


${symbol_pound} Delays a function for the given number of milliseconds, and then calls
${symbol_pound} it with the arguments supplied.

  setTimeout((-> func.apply(func, args)), wait)


${symbol_pound} Memoize an expensive function by storing its results.
_.memoize = (func, hasher) ->

    return memo[key] if key of memo
    memo[key] = func.apply this, arguments


${symbol_pound} Defers a function, scheduling it to run after the current call stack has
${symbol_pound} cleared.
_.defer = (func) ->
  _.delay.apply _, [func, 1].concat _.rest arguments


${symbol_pound} Returns the first function passed as an argument to the second,
${symbol_pound} allowing you to adjust arguments, run code before and after, and
${symbol_pound} conditionally execute the original function.
_.wrap = (func, wrapper) ->
  -> wrapper.apply wrapper, [func].concat arguments


${symbol_pound} Returns a function that is the composition of a list of functions, each
${symbol_pound} consuming the return value of the function that follows.
_.compose = ->
  funcs = arguments
  ->
    args = arguments
    for i in [funcs.length - 1..0] by -1
      args = [funcs[i].apply(this, args)]

_.clone = (obj) ->
  return obj.slice 0 if _.isArray obj
  _.extend {}, obj


${symbol_pound} Invokes interceptor with the obj, and then returns obj.
${symbol_pound} The primary purpose of this method is to "tap into" a method chain,
${symbol_pound} in order to perform operations on intermediate results within
 the chain.
_.tap = (obj, interceptor) ->
  interceptor obj
  obj


${symbol_pound} Perform a deep comparison to check if two objects are equal.
_.isEqual = (a, b) ->
  ${symbol_pound} Check object identity.

  return false if atype isnt 'object'
  ${symbol_pound} Check for different array lengths before comparing contents.
  return false if a.length and (a.length isnt b.length)
  ${symbol_pound} Nothing else worked, deep compare the contents.
  aKeys = _.keys(a); bKeys = _.keys(b)
  ${symbol_pound} Different object sizes?
  return false if aKeys.length isnt bKeys.length
  ${symbol_pound} Recursive comparison of contents.
  return false for key, val of a when !(key of b) or !_.isEqual(val, b[key])

${symbol_pound} Is the given value a regular expression?
_.isRegExp = (obj) -> !!(obj and obj.exec and (obj.ignoreCase or obj.ignoreCase is false))


${symbol_pound} Is the given value NaN -- this one is interesting. `NaN != NaN`, and
${symbol_pound} `isNaN(undefined) == true`, so we make sure it's a number first.
_.isNaN = (obj) -> _.isNumber(obj) and window.isNaN(obj)


${symbol_pound} Is a given value equal to null?
_.isNull = (obj) -> obj is null


${symbol_pound} Is a given variable undefined?

_.templateSettings = {
  start: '<%'
  end: '%>'
  interpolate: /<%=(.+?)%>/g
}

${symbol_pound} Setup the OOP Wrapper
${symbol_pound} ---------------------

${symbol_pound} If Underscore is called as a function, it returns a wrapped object that
${symbol_pound} can be used OO-style. This wrapper holds altered versions of all the
${symbol_pound} underscore functions. Wrapped objects may be chained.

    result func.apply(_, args), this._chain


${symbol_pound} Add all ofthe Underscore functions to the wrapper object.
_.mixin _


${symbol_pound} Add all mutator Array functions to the wrapper.
_.each ['pop', 'push', 'reverse', 'shift', 'sort', 'splice', 'unshift'], (name) ->
