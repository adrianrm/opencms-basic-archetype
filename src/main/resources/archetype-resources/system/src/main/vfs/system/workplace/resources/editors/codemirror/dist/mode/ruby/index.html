${symbol_pound} Code from http://sandbox.mc.edu/~bennet/ruby/code/poly_rb.html
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} This program evaluates polynomials.  It first asks for the coefficients
${symbol_pound} of a polynomial, which must be entered on one line, highest-order first.
${symbol_pound} It then requests values of x and will compute the value of the poly for
${symbol_pound} each x.  It will repeatly ask for x values, unless you the user enters
${symbol_pound} a blank line.  It that case, it will ask for another polynomial.  If the
${symbol_pound} user types quit for either input, the program immediately exits.
${symbol_pound}

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Function to evaluate a polynomial at x.  The polynomial is given
${symbol_pound} as a list of coefficients, from the greatest to the least.
def polyval(x, coef)
    sum = 0
    coef = coef.clone           ${symbol_pound} Don't want to destroy the original
    while true
        sum += coef.shift       ${symbol_pound} Add and remove the next coef
        break if coef.empty?    ${symbol_pound} If no more, done entirely.
        sum *= x                ${symbol_pound} This happens the right number of times.
    end
    return sum
end

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Function to read a line containing a list of integers and return
${symbol_pound} them as an array of integers.  If the string conversion fails, it
${symbol_pound} throws TypeError.  If the input line is the word 'quit', then it
${symbol_pound} converts it to an end-of-file exception
def readints(prompt)
    ${symbol_pound} Read a line
    print prompt
    line = readline.chomp
    raise EOFError.new if line == 'quit' ${symbol_pound} You can also use a real EOF.
            
    ${symbol_pound} Go through each item on the line, converting each one and adding it
    ${symbol_pound} to retval.
    retval = [ ]
    for str in line.split(/${symbol_escape}s+/)
        if str =~ /^${symbol_escape}-?${symbol_escape}d+${symbol_dollar}/
            retval.push(str.to_i)
        else
            raise TypeError.new
        end
    end

    return retval
end

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Take a coeff and an exponent and return the string representation, ignoring
${symbol_pound} the sign of the coefficient.
def term_to_str(coef, exp)
    ret = ""

    ${symbol_pound} Show coeff, unless it's 1 or at the right
    coef = coef.abs
    ret = coef.to_s     unless coef == 1 && exp > 0
    ret += "x" if exp > 0                               ${symbol_pound} x if exponent not 0
    ret += "^" + exp.to_s if exp > 1                    ${symbol_pound} ^exponent, if > 1.

    return ret
end

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Create a string of the polynomial in sort-of-readable form.
def polystr(p)
    ${symbol_pound} Get the exponent of first coefficient, plus 1.
    exp = p.length

    ${symbol_pound} Assign exponents to each term, making pairs of coeff and exponent,
    ${symbol_pound} Then get rid of the zero terms.
    p = (p.map { |c| exp -= 1; [ c, exp ] }).select { |p| p[0] != 0 }

    ${symbol_pound} If there's nothing left, it's a zero
    return "0" if p.empty?

    ${symbol_pound} *** Now p is a non-empty list of [ coef, exponent ] pairs. ***

    ${symbol_pound} Convert the first term, preceded by a "-" if it's negative.
    result = (if p[0][0] < 0 then "-" else "" end) + term_to_str(*p[0])

    ${symbol_pound} Convert the rest of the terms, in each case adding the appropriate
    ${symbol_pound} + or - separating them.  
    for term in p[1...p.length]
        ${symbol_pound} Add the separator then the rep. of the term.
        result += (if term[0] < 0 then " - " else " + " end) + 
                term_to_str(*term)
    end

    return result
end
        
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Run until some kind of endfile.
begin
    ${symbol_pound} Repeat until an exception or quit gets us out.
    while true
        ${symbol_pound} Read a poly until it works.  An EOF will except out of the
        ${symbol_pound} program.
        print "${symbol_escape}n"
        begin
            poly = readints("Enter a polynomial coefficients: ")
        rescue TypeError
            print "Try again.${symbol_escape}n"
            retry
        end
        break if poly.empty?

        ${symbol_pound} Read and evaluate x values until the user types a blank line.
        ${symbol_pound} Again, an EOF will except out of the pgm.
        while true
            ${symbol_pound} Request an integer.
            print "Enter x value or blank line: "
            x = readline.chomp
            break if x == ''
            raise EOFError.new if x == 'quit'

            ${symbol_pound} If it looks bad, let's try again.
            if x !~ /^${symbol_escape}-?${symbol_escape}d+${symbol_dollar}/
                print "That doesn't look like an integer.  Please try again.${symbol_escape}n"
                next
            end

            ${symbol_pound} Convert to an integer and print the result.
            x = x.to_i
            print "p(x) = ", polystr(poly), "${symbol_escape}n"
            print "p(", x, ") = ", polyval(x, poly), "${symbol_escape}n"
        end
    end
rescue EOFError
    print "${symbol_escape}n=== EOF ===${symbol_escape}n"
rescue Interrupt, SignalException
    print "${symbol_escape}n=== Interrupted ===${symbol_escape}n"
else
    print "--- Bye ---${symbol_escape}n"
